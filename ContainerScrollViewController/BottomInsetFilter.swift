import UIKit

/// An object that applies a temporal filter to the scroll view's bottom additional
/// safe area inset, so rapid sequences of adjustments are filtered out.
///
/// When a text field becomes the first responder, or the first responder changes
/// when the user taps on another text field, UIKit will present the keyboard or
/// adjust its height if an input accessory view is specified.
///
/// Often, these changes will generate a sequence of keyboardWillShow notifications,
/// often with radically different values. As an extreme example, if a text field is
/// populated using the auto-fill input accessory view, and this action causes a
/// password text field to automatically become the first responder, one
/// keyboardWillHide notifications and two keyboardWillShow notifications will be
/// posted within the span of 0.1 seconds.
///
/// If KeyboardObserver responded to each of these notifications individually, this
/// would cause discontinuities in our scroll view animation that accompanies
/// keyboard changes.
///
/// To work around this issue, BottomInsetFilter filters out sequences of
/// notifications that occur within a small time window, acting only on the final
/// assigned bottom inset in the sequence.
