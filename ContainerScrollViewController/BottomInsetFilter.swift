import UIKit

/// An object that applies a temporal filter to the scroll view's bottom additional
/// safe area inset, so that rapid sequences of adjustments are filtered out.
///
/// When a text field becomes the first responder, UIKit presents the keyboard. If
/// the user taps on another text field, changing the first responder, UIKit may
/// adjust the keyboard's height if an input accessory view is specified. Often,
/// these changes will generate a sequence of `keyboardWillShow` notifications, each
/// with different keyboard heights.
///
/// As an extreme example, if the user populates a text field by tapping on an
/// AutoFill input accessory view, and this action causes a password text field to
/// automatically become the first responder, one `keyboardWillHide` notifications
/// and two `keyboardWillShow` notifications will be posted within the span of 0.1
/// seconds.
///
/// If `KeyboardObserver` were to respond to each of these notifications
/// individually, this would cause awkward discontinuities in our scroll view
/// animation that accompanies changes to the keyboard's height.
///
/// To work around this issue, `BottomInsetFilter` filters out sequences of
/// notifications that occur within a small time window, acting only on the final
/// assigned bottom inset in the sequence.
